# Creating a Proposal for Hazel Improvement (PHI)
* Clone this repository.
* Determine the number and name for your PHI:
  * The number should be the next available number. To determine the next available number, look at:
  
    1. the existing directories in master; and
    2. the list of branches on GitHub.
    
    Make sure you are not using the same number as somebody else.

  * The name should be a dash-separated sequence of lowercase letters.
* Create a new branch named `#-name` where `#` is your PHI number and `name` is the name you chose.
* Create a new directory named `#-name`.
* Create a new file named `#-name.md` in that directory.
* Push your new branch to GitHub immediately so that there are not number choice clashes.
* We may provide an outline for PHIs in the future, but for now consult with cyrus- or others in FP Lab.

# Pronunciation
PHI is pronounced however you'd like to pronounce the greek letter "phi" (like "pie" or "fee").
