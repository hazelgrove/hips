# 11-type-constructors

## Introduction

see my SURE poster for a motivating example.  
(fill in) a slightly misleading title, the “intended" application is
parameterized types

## TODO

-   clean derivations w/ abbreviations (looking at you A0 page)

-   OK\* proofs

-   Sigma kinds

-   KEquiv-Π has a typo: κ1/2/3/4 premisses screwed up

-   KEquiv-SKind: premisses order should be flipped (implementing
    left→right)

## Notes

-   elaboration rules should be straightforward from bkase’s phi
